# Data Scientist

### Summary
<div style="text-align: justify;">

A Data Scientist and Ph.D. candidate in mathematical modeling with a strong background in system modeling, physics, and modern machine learning frameworks. I have a bachelor's and a Master's in Physics, and I am proficient in Python (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, PyTorch, SciKit), SQL, machine learning, deep learning, statistics, high-performance computing, optimization, linear algebra, and data visualization. I have experience with statistical modeling for private equity investments at Adaggio Music Funda and improving data quality and model performance in risk management for hedge fund investments at Pyrite Risk Experts. My thesis focuses on physics-constrained neural networks, particularly solving nonlinear systems of differential equations in epidemiology.
